          Bootstrap is an open-code framework based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript
          which allows to create webpages in an easy and fast way. It offers
          predefined styles, responsive design with grid system, reusable
          components and compatibility between browsers.

                I find it both interesting and practical that Bootstrap allows
                you to easily add interactive elements like carousels or
                dropdowns to a webpage by simply linking its CSS and JS files
                and inserting each component‚Äôs code snippet. This saves time and
                lets you focus on other aspects such as the content of your
                webpage.

                The use of breakpoints facilitates the adaptation of layouts
                across devices and it gives you several options of column
                layouts in order to choose the one that adapts to your page's

        <p style="font-size: 1em; color: #555; line-height: 1.6">
          Tailwind CSS is a utility framework that allows you to design
          responsive and customizable web interfaces by applying classes
          directly to HTML, without imposing a pre-designed aesthetic. It
          enables more flexibility to create your site from beginning, but it
          involves a harder learning-curve and it requires Node.js and a modern
          development environment.

              <p class="card-text">
                I found it very curious how Tailwind automatically removes
                unnecessary CSS so the webpage loads faster. I have struggled in
                the past with big CSS files that slow down the loading of my
                page so I find this tool particularly useful.
                <strong>Unfortunately</strong>, the downside is that in order to
                make the CSS smaller, you need to add utility classes to the
                HTML which can end up making it too long and hard to read.
                However, I believe with good organisation and differentiation,
                it can be managed.

                One of the greatest advantages of Tailwind is that it allows you
                to customise your themes, colour palettes, spacing, or fonts by
                employing utility classes, which can ultimately make your
                website look unique and creative rather than a standard layout
                or template.

          Material UI is a React component library based on Google Material
          Design which allows you to create modern, responsive, accessible and
          personalised interfaces although it is a bit more limited to

                I find this UI kit very easy to implement as it includes
                ready-made templates. This is great for certain projects where
                efficiency and consistency are more important than creativity
                and originality. <strong>Downside:</strong> The use of templates
                can be very useful to begin with, but it can end up looking too
                generic if you don¬¥t customise it to fit your style and needs.
                This customisation might take more time and the learning curve
                might be tougher so that¬¥s something to consider.

          Ark UI is a headless component library that offers accessible and
          customizable building blocks for modern web applications. It is
          compatible with any style system and it is also multiframework.
          Furthermore, it allows developers to have full control over the look
          and feel since they can create the aesthetic of components which are
          not tied to specific styles.

                The amount of components that Ark UI offers is quite impressive
                and useful to incorporate in my projects. It includes basic
                components such as buttons to more complex ones such as
                passwords, menus and even signature pads or date pickers. It has
                almost every component you would need for your site so I would
                highly consider incorporating them in my sites.

                The fact that components do not have default styles allows you
                to customise them in order to fit your aesthetic which is really
                useful to build a design-centered and original website. Ark UI
                gives you the base and you can build up from there. It is also
                compatible with many styling solutions such as TailwindCSS so
                using both would be an option to consider in future projects.

          Jekyll is an open-code static site generator written in Ruby which
          takes files written in Markdown or HTML, processes them with
          templates, and converts them into a static website (HTML, CSS, and JS
          files) that can be easily published. It is a bit slower in the
          generation of bigger sites but it can be easily integrated with GitHub
          pages.

                I learnt about front matter and the use of variables to manage
                metadata in Jekyll using YAML. This allows you to establish
                variables such as title or layout at the beginning of the site
                in order to use them across different pages. This ensures
                consistency and it saves time and space since you only need to
                change it once in the front matter instead of in every
                individual page.

                acts as a glue between content (Markdown) and metadata (YAML),
                placing them into HTML layouts. The result is a static site with
                dynamic content which I find very interesting and convenient.

                The depth of GSAP is quite outstanding. However, one of the
                features that caught my attention the most was the ScrollTrigger
                plugin. I imagine this can be really handy to create interactive
                and immersive webpages that react to the user¬¥s scrolling
                behaviour. A good example would be a portfolio which would more
                depth and dynamisms thanks to this plugin and would be more
                original and eye-catching to users.

                very useful if you want to incorporate lots of different

                Another feature that I found interesting is the possibility of
                animating SVGs which can be very useful to add interactivity to
                the logos and icons of your webpage. Within this feature there
                are several options such as morphTo(), to morph one SVG into
                another or the motionPath() to animate the SVG along a specified
                path. Additionally I really like how the website of Anime.js
                animates sections to showcase each feature, making it more
                appealing and easy to understand.

                    charging and publishing webpage which is necessary when you
                    need to achieve results in a short period of time. It is
                    also more accessible to learn as the use of frameworks such
                    as Bootstrap can accelerate the development of the page.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Cons ‚ùå:</strong> When you prioritise speed you can

                    on templates which can end up looking too generic.

                    <strong>Pros ‚úÖ:</strong> Flexibility allows your webpage to
                    grow and adapt in the long run so it can expand beyond the
                    prototyping phase. In addition, it makes it easier to create
                    a unique and brand-adapted design which can integrate
                    different tools other than pre-made templates. You also have

              There is not right or wrong but it all depends on the kind of
              project you want to develop. In the particular case of the
              portfolio, if it is a static page that does not need maintenance I
              would choose speed. However, I would personally want to
              incorporate dynamic and time-changing storytelling, so for me
              flexibility would be essential. Identity, scalability and creative
              control are preferable so I would opt for a more flexible approach
              even though it implies spending more time on the development of
              the project.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Pros ‚úÖ:</strong> Node.js is ideal for certain
                    applications such as chats or online streaming with
                    real-time data. It is compatible with Windows, mac and linux

                    <strong>Cons ‚ùå:</strong> Although it is very fast, it can

                    <strong>Pros ‚úÖ:</strong> One of the most obvious pros of

                    will ultimately take less time to charge.

              I think for this project I would use standalone development as the
              foundation for speed and simplicity but I would also consider
              integrating tools such as Ark UI in the future, which incorporates
              logic and accessibility to components in order to add flexibility
              and creativity. I believe a good balance between both approaches
              is ideal.

                    <strong>Pros ‚úÖ:</strong> Simplicity means only employing
                    plain HTML, CSS and JS in your project. One of the main
                    advantages is that you have full control of everything that
                    your code does and you don¬¥t depend on external libraries.
                    Additionally, it is more lightweight and faster which result
                    in better performance and SEO. Moreover, it allows you to
                    work on the same project and update it without updates or
                    failures linked to external programs and it gives you more
                    creative freedom without the risk of creating a standard, no
                    personality page.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cons ‚ùå:</strong> One of the main disadvantages is
                    the longer initial develop time as you don¬¥t have pre-made
                    components and grids. You need to master HTML, CSS and JS in
                    order to create a full functioning web and it can become a
                    bit chaotic in bigger projects if there is not organisation.
                    You also risk creating inconsistent pages across the web
                    which can be prevented with the use of some dependencies.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Pros ‚úÖ:</strong> Using dependencies in your
                    projects such as Bootstrap, Tailwind or Material UI, allow
                    us to develop webpages in a faster and more efficient way,
                    incorporating layouts, ready-made components or animations.
                    Furthermore, it generates consistency and cohesiveness,
                    creating professional-looking and uniform websites.

                    In addition, you might lose creativity as you are using
                    pre-made components and elements that might look too
                    standard if not personalised. You also depend on external
                    programs and libraries so you might generate some dependency
                    to them, having to adjust to updates, new versions and even

              <strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />
              I feel the solution is to incorporate a hybrid method in which
              there is a solid HTML, CSS and JS code as a base which you can
              fully control and then add the necessary dependencies such as
              Tailwind for utilities or Animate.js for animations.

            <h3 class="reflection__h3">Convention vs. Creativity</h3>
            <p>
              Convention implies following established industry patterns such as
              frameworks or design systems. This could mean using
              <strong> Bootstrap</strong> for the layout or pages with a default
              structure. <br /><br />
              Creativity means breaking the rules, experimenting with
              interaction, fonts and layouts without following trends or
              standards. You could use <strong>Anime.js</strong> to add unique
              microinteractions to a portfolio with a less conventional
              navigation or visual storytelling.

                    <strong>Pros ‚úÖ:</strong> Some of the advantages are
                    familiarity for the user since it imitates standard patterns
                    that repeat across pages. It also becomes faster to develop
                    and its appearance is professional and standardised.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Cons ‚ùå:</strong> On the other hand, it lacks visual
                    identity as you risk appearing as another template which can
                    make you stand out less in the creative industry, specially
                    if you are creating your portfolio.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Pros ‚úÖ:</strong> It is clear that creativity makes
                    you memorable as it reflects your personal or brand identity
                    and makes you innovate in UI and UX with animations, visuals
                    and interactions.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Cons ‚ùå:</strong> You have the risk of confusing the
                    user who is used to traditional layouts and interfaces,
                    breaking established usability patterns. It also takes more
                    time, effort and technical abilities to develop a working
                    webpage.

              <strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br />
              There is not a single solution and it varies based on your
              personal preferences. I would want a creative and personal
              portfolio but I also like simplicity as a starter point. I would
              make sure navigation is clear and it follows some of the most
              important standards. In addition, I would use a legible font for
              the body of the webpage paired with a funkier and more creative
              typography for titles or small pieces of information. I would
              incorporate creativity with the inclusion of Anime.js or GSAP
              microinteractions, a unique colour palette and visual storytelling
              where my design pieces speak for themselves.

              How would I incorporate these tools in my portfolio site:

              <p>
                I am not entirely sure I would use these tools for my portfolio
                or just create my site from scratch but these are some of the
                options I would consider choosing:
              </p>
              <li>
                <strong>Framework base:</strong> I would employ
                <strong> Bootstrap </strong>due to its consistency and
                simplicity. The downside of Bootstrap is that it could end up
                looking too generic which is not the objective.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Animations:</strong> I would use
                <strong>GSAP</strong> for smooth and light animations because it
                has a bit more complexity than Anime.js but it is still easier
                than doing the animations myself from scratch.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>UI Components:</strong> I would consider employing
                <strong>Ark UI</strong> to organise and add logic and
                accessibility to Bootstrap components.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Static generator:</strong> I would consider using
                <strong>Hugo</strong> as a static site generator to start with a
                strong base.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Images:</strong> For image optimisation I would
                definitely use <strong>ImageKit</strong> as I really like its
                interface and it is crucial to optimise images.
              </li>
