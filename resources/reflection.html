          Creating the site was a learning process with mistakes included which
          made me find skills to solve them. I had some problems with the
          responsive design and how images fit into each container. I also had
          to take into account extra elements crucial for interactivity and
          efficiency within the web like arrows and scrolls. Taking the content
          into account I had to establish different sections and containers to
          include the information and photos but it was challenging to make it
          look balanced and organised. I also wanted to add tables and more
          interactive elements like emojis across the page to make it funner.
          Furthermore, for the reflection section I decided to make a dropdown
          so that it looked cleaner visually. For the legend I also struggled to
          make it disappear when scrolling down but with lots of trials I
          achieved the desired result.

          <br /><br />This practice made me realise the importance of trial and
          error and how content conditions aesthetics in web design. I sometimes
          struggle to organised all the data so it was a struggle to keep
          everything neat and clear but I am content and proud with the final
          result.
